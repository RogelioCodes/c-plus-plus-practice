// HW3P3 Instruction - what to add to slist.h

// The copy constructor to allow pass by value and return
// The regular copy constructor does not work well with pointers
slist(const slist&);

// overloading =
// The operator = does not work well with pointers
slist& operator=(const slist&);

// overload == which normally does not work with Objects
// It returns true only if the two lists look identical
// For testing this, you must create Client2.cpp 


// The code to put in the implementation file slist.cpp are in Notes-7A
