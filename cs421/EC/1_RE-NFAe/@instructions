1. RE to NFA-e

Must use and complete the re-nfaeEC.cpp file.   

In re.txt, we must type all the arrow labels we plan to use, one per line. 
e.g.
a
b
c
Component machines are created for these.

nfa-e.txt will be the output showing the combined machines.

Limitation:  It does not allow you to do (a | a)   
It can be overcome by always making a copy of the component machine first.
 
re-nfae.out demonstrates how your program should work.
