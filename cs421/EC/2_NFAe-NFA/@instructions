2. NFA-e to NFA

Must use and complete nfaeRemoveEC.cpp 

In the nfa-e.txt file, we must put the highest state number first.
Then on the subsequent lines, put Trs of the NFA:
state char state state .... -1
where e stands for epsilon 

Output is nfa.txt

nfaRemove.out demonstrates how your program should work.
